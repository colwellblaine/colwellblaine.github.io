				<h1>I am working on:</h1><br><br>
				<h3>My education!</h3>
				<p>Of course. I am currently working on getting enrolled in a bachelor's program in Information and Cybersecurity. I am also working on CompTIA's Linux+ and CASP+, and eventually the OSCP</p><br><br>
				<h3>Various small bash scripts</h3>
				<p>Odds and ends to make basic tasks easier</p><br><br>
				<h3>A Linux variant I'm calling cerberos</h3>
				<p>Based off an old, somewhat out-of-date pentesting system that a friend gave me, and named after the greek three-headed dog. It was originally called kerberos, both after the more greek spelling of cerberos, and after the ticket-granting technology. I felt this was a bit too on-the-nose.</p>
				<p style="font-size:50%">Fun fact cerberus could roughly be translated as "spotted". The Greacian god of the underworld called his dog "spot".</p><br><br>
				<h3>I am currently learning programming/scripting languages</h3>
				<p>I am mostly focused on Rust, but am also planning to learn python and/or ruby</p><br><br>
				<h3>A <a href="https://github.com/codingneko/nerve">Nerve</a> Page</h3><br><br>
				<h3>My website, obviously</h3><br><br>
				<h3>Setting up some form of peer-to-peer messaging system | or | an irc server</h3><br><br>
				<h3>Various other small and personal projects</h3>
				<p>If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@colwellblaine.com?subject=colwellblaine%20website">Email me</a>, or contact me at #collwellblaine on freenode. I'm not on irc much, but that's the best way to contact me after you've emailed me.</p>
