				<h1>I am working on:</h1><br><br>
				<h3>My education!</h3>
				<p>Of course. I am currently enrolled in the assosiate's program at IvyTech. I am also working on CompTIA's Linux+ and CASP+, and eventually the OSCP</p><br><br>
				<h3>I am currently learning programming/scripting languages</h3>
				<p>I am currently working on python, and am planning on diving more into ruby and rust at a later date.</p><br><br>
				<h3><s>A <a href="https://github.com/codingneko/nerve">Nerve</a> Page</s></h3><br><br>
				<p>This is on hold for now until I can get ahold of the developer of nerve. It appears to have been taken down, and the least I'd like to do is host a copy of it, if not take it over.</p>
				<h3>My website, obviously</h3><br><br>
				<p>Also on hold until I can get a proper host, most likely in the form of a cloud host.</p>
				<h3>Setting up some form of peer-to-peer messaging system | or | an irc server</h3><br><br>
				<h3>Various other small and personal projects</h3>
				<p>If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@colwellblaine.com?subject=colwellblaine%20website">Email me</a>, or add me on discord with "ðŸ¦†.#2722". That might not show up right, I do not know.</p>
