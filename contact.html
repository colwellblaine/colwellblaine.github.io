				<h1>Contact Me</h1><br>
				<h3><a href="mailto:contact@colwellblaine.com?subject=colwellblaine%20website">Email</a></h3>
				<p>I don't check my email super often, so another method might be better.</p><br>

				<br><h3>Phone</h3>
				<p>My phone number is (317) 993-0890. This is likely the best way to get ahold of me.</p><br>

				<br><h3><a href="https://urbit.org/">Urbit</a></h3>
				<p>Urbit is a rather interesting program that I've been checking out recently. This is probably the worst of the three overall when it comes to getting ahold of me, but might be the best if I happen to be looking at it.</p>
				<p>I currently only have a comet. This is the lowest level of node ("ship") on the network, and is made using a hash of your urbit ID. As such, it is free, but is relatively long. The entire next line is my urbit ID, and where you can Message me. Just add me to a DM.</p>
