		<h1>So, what's up with Nerve?</h1><br>
		<p style="padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">Nerve was a sort-of hybrid message-board/image-board that I thought looked really promising. Apparently the creator, codingneko, did not entirely agree with me on that, and deleted the github repo. Since then, as I have mentioned, I've found Urbit, which has a function almost identical to nerve, but with many improvements as well.</p>
